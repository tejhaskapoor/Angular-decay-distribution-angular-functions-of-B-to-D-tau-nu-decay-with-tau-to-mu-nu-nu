# Angular decay distribution angular functions of $B_d \to D^* (\to D \pi ) \tau (\to \mu \bar{\nu_\mu}$ $\nu_\tau) \bar{\nu}_\tau$ decay 

## $J$ functions of $B_d \to D^* (\to D \pi ) \tau (\to \mu \bar{\nu_\mu}$ $\nu_\tau) \bar{\nu}_\tau$

This mathematica notebook is a part of appendix of PhD thesis of Tejhas Kapoor
(PhD student at IJC Lab, University Paris-Saclay )


This mathematica file contains the J functions used for writing the angular decay distribution of  $B_d \to D^*  \tau  \bar{\nu_\tau}$, where the $\tau$ decays to  $\mu \bar{\nu_\mu}$ $\nu_\tau$. The theoretical details of this calculation and the definition of J functions is given in my PhD thesis, of which this file is a part. 

One needs Mathematica on their device to open this notebook.
